# Digit-Recognizer-in-Python
One of the most exciting applications of Deep Neural Networks is character recognition. This repository contains the dataset and code file for a Digit recognizer model. 

The basic concept used in developing this model is Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs). CNN is a very efficient way of reducing the number of parameters while increasing the depth of Neural Networks. The file named 'code.py' conatins the model of a CNN which I developed for digit recognizer. The Model is inspired from the famous LeNet which was published in a paper in 1998 by Yann LeCun. The source code for the original paper is in the file 'LeCun.py'.
